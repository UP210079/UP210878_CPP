WELCOME TO UNIT 1: CONTROL STRUCTURES AND CYCLES

### This unit is about control structures and cycles, shocking.
This section is a W. I. P. I haven't done anything in this unit yet; which means it won't have as much fancy stuff as you'd like to see until later. Because I've figured that it would be best to have a related image, the cat has sadly been replaced by this nice boring cycle I've found randomly on the internet.

### Summary
Short explanation about what the executable does.
### Explanation
Detailed explanation about how the software works.
Maybe I can even add the steps I took to make the program. Like this:
> Step one: Do this  
> Step two: ???  
> Step three: Done  
### Sources (If any)
In case I consult additional sources to help the realization of the project.
