WELCOME TO UNIT 4: FILES AND ARRAYS

### In case you don't know, this is about files and arrays.
This section is a W. I. P. I haven't done anything in this unit yet; which means it won't have as much fancy stuff as you'd like to see until later. Alright so last time I got bored and wanted to try a MS painting. However, since I run the risk of getting expelled by putting innappropiate images (Â¿), I've decided to play it safe again and use an image I've found browsing.
